## Features
- **Two Modes of Play**: Choose to play against a human opponent or challenge our AI.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Built using Tkinter for an easy and interactive gaming experience.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: The AI opponent is powered by the minimax algorithm, making it a challenging adversary.
